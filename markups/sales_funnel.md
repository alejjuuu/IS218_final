# SUMMARY

A lead funnel captures attention and converts it into a lead by gathering contact information.
In exchange for their contact details, potential leads receive something valuable.

This strategy allows businesses to further market to potential customers, guiding them up the value ladder.

The process involves capturing attention (often from social media), redirecting to an opt-in page, obtaining contact details, and then sending valuable content via email.

Offerings to entice leads can vary, such as mini-trainings, discounts, ebooks, or even through informative blog posts.

Surveys or quizzes can also serve as lead magnets, requiring an email address submission to see results.
