# Top Level User Stories

## Initiative:  

Lily is looking for a new brand after finding that her old favorite makeup brand was accused of stealing formulas from their competitors as well (as learning that it was using lead in their formulas) and is looking for a quality makeup brand that takes their product development seriously.

## Epic (Awareness) :  

Lily looks through makeup blogs to find ethical brands.

## Epic (Interest):  

Lily finds “brandName” on the list and with the picture the blog poster showed of the brand, she decides she will visit the site. She is greeted by the hero section and sees the brand message as well as an offer to sign up for email digests and sees that she could get a $50 gift bag for spending over $100 on the store. She is immediately interested. 

## Epic (Action): 

She sees that there is an input form she needs to fill out for the coupon for the $50 gift bag.

## Epic (Loyalty):   

Lily opens up her email. She scrolls through the email, looking at some of their best-selling products, info about makeup, and then goes to the end to copy the coupon code. She sees that she needs to use the coupon within 30 days, and sees how she could use it after seeing information about their best-selling products in the email.
