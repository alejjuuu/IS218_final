Lily is an 5-year employee (current manager) for an advertising agency. Using makeup to look professional in meetings, she wears very basic colors and is required to wear it for long periods of time. Learning of her favorite company’s scandals, she realized the importance of learning what was going on in the products she put on her face. Willing to spend on premium products, she is looking for a makeup brand that explains its benefits and doesn’t have any harmful ingredients. She would also like to support an ethical company that doesn’t do anything malicious.
