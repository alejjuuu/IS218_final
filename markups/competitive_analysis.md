Our Brand
Our business is a science/research-based make-up brand. The brand archetypes are Sage/Innocent. The methods of persuasion we will use are Reciprocity, Social Proof, Authority, Liking, and Scarcity. Our persona, “Lily,” is looking for a new brand after finding that her old favorite makeup brand was accused of stealing formulas from their competitors as well (as learning that it was using lead in their formulas) and is looking for a quality makeup brand that takes their product development seriously. Our business is a science-focused makeup company that utilizes scientific research to formulate special ingredients for our products. We focus on the stable quality of our products and care for our customers and teach them more about makeup and the ingredients used. Our high-end brand is polished and elegant. The name of the brand is ForverYou.
